# Comment-Box

A page that appends comments to the document. [Deployed here](https://taha-hassan-git.github.io/Comment-Box/)

## Summary

The user can input a name, email, comment and submit. THe submit button is not activated until all three fields have an input. There is currently
no regex on the name or email fields, unfortunately, something to add in future.
